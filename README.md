# Simple-To-Do-List
This is a very simplified version of a To-Do List

## The languages and tools we are using

### CSS
While HTML is a markup language used to format/structure a web page, CSS is a design language that you use to make your web page look nice and presentable.
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and you use it to improve the appearance of a web page. By adding thoughtful CSS styles, you make your page more attractive and pleasant for the end user to view and use.

### JS
Now, if HTML is the markup language and CSS is the design language, then JavaScript is the programming language.


### HTML
So you can think of HTML as the language used for creating detailed instructions concerning style, type, format, structure and the makeup of a web page before it gets printed (shown to you).
HTML helps you structure your page into elements such as paragraphs, sections, headings, navigation bars, and so on.  

### Conclusion 

As a web developer, the three main languages we use to build websites are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
JavaScript is the programming language, we use HTML to structure the site, and we use CSS to design and layout the web page.
